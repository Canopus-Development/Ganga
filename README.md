# Ganga Firmware Documentation

## Overview

**Ganga Firmware** is an open-source firmware example designed for Raspberry Pi and similar devices. It integrates advanced features such as computer vision, speech recognition, emotion detection, and biometric authentication. This firmware serves as a comprehensive starting point for developers interested in building sophisticated IoT applications that require real-time processing and AI capabilities.

The firmware leverages several cutting-edge technologies and frameworks including:

- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes models like YOLOS for object detection and face recognition.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Implements OpenAI's Whisper and Microsoft's SpeechT5 models.
- **Emotion Detection**: Employs emotion classification models for analyzing facial expressions.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Provides secure user identification through facial recognition.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built using Python's `asyncio` library for efficient I/O operations and concurrency.
- **API Server**: Offers a FastAPI-based server for extending functionalities and integrating with external services.

This firmware is modular and designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily add new features or replace components as needed.

## Features

- **Open Source**: Licensed under the Ganga Open Source License (see below), allowing for community contributions and modifications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Optimized to run on CPU-only devices, making it suitable for Raspberry Pi and other low-power hardware.
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are decoupled and interact through well-defined interfaces, facilitating customization and upgrades.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integrates pre-trained models for vision and speech tasks, with options to replace or fine-tune models.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Includes a system monitor to track CPU, memory, and temperature, ensuring the firmware operates within safe parameters.
- **Security**: Implements JWT authentication and secure token handling in the API server.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Comprehensive logging and exception handling for easier debugging and maintenance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi or similar device with a camera and microphone.
- **Operating System**: Linux-based OS recommended.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Refer to `requirements.txt` for a list of required Python packages.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Canopus-Development/ganga.git
   cd ganga-firmware
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the necessary configurations. Refer to `config/settings.py` for required environment variables.

5. **Set Up Required Directories**

   The firmware will automatically create necessary directories for data, models, cache, and known faces. Ensure that the device has sufficient storage space.

### Running the Firmware

To start the firmware in local mode:

```bash
python main.py local
```

To start the firmware with the API server:

```bash
python main.py server
```

### Extending the Firmware

Developers are encouraged to extend the firmware by adding new modules or replacing existing ones. The modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional functionalities, such as:

- Adding new vision models or replacing the object detection component.
- Implementing custom speech synthesis voices or languages.
- Integrating with other biometric authentication methods.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork on GitHub and clone it locally.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Use descriptive names for new branches.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix.
4. **Run Tests**: Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Explain your changes and await feedback.
